To accurately recognize a user's voice, you must pronounce it slowly and accurately from the language in the System Speech Recognition menu to the selected language.\r\nVoice recognition includes interactive voice recognition that is used as if talking to a TV and command-type voice recognition that is used only with a set command. To use interactive voice recognition, you must have completed Internet connectivity, smart hub settings, agreement on terms and conditions, and time settings. When voice recognition is executed without setting, a setting guide pop-up is displayed. If you complete the settings according to the instructions, you can use interactive voice recognition.

And can I connect earphones or headsets to the rear terminal by wire? It's called audio minijack, but doesn't regular stereojack have an output terminal?\r\nAnswers\r\nHello. Sir/ma'am.\r\nI am the person in charge of Samsung Electronics service cyber center.\r\nPlease understand that the UN50F6900AF model you inquired about does not support Bluetooth headsets and cannot be connected to wireless headsets.\r\nThe UN50F6900AF model does not support earphone terminals (stereo jacks) and only has voice output terminals.\r\nThe voice output terminal is a terminal that only outputs the sound from the TV as it is, and when the earphone is connected, the sound is output to the TV and also to the earphone.\r\nThe voice output terminal cannot adjust the volume, and in the case of the earphone jack terminal, is the sound muted so that the sound cannot be output to the TV speaker? , the voice output terminal is not muted, so audio output is performed together with the TV and the earphone connected to the voice output terminal.\r\nIn other words, if the volume of the TV is reduced after connecting the earphone to the voice output terminal, the TV speaker does not make a sound, and the earphone terminal outputs audio, but the size of the output audio volume cannot be adjusted.\r\nPlease understand that the UN50F6900AF model does not have a Bluetooth headset and earphone terminal.\r\nThank you."

		"answer": "Question content\r\nUN50H6430AF is being used.\r\nIt is not equipped with a wireless LAN, so I am using a Samsung genuine wireless LAN plugged into USB.\r\nNot long ago, there was a Geumyoung karaoke app on the smart hub, so it was beneficial and good to run it, so I bought a USB microphone (KSM-508) through Geumyoung Shopping Mall, plugged it into USB, and used it, and it came out about 0.5 seconds late when the microphone voice was output to the speaker. There are a total of 3 USB terminals on the TV, and it's the same even if you plug them in.\r\nAs a result of the inquiry to Geumyoung, I exchanged it for the same other product, but it's the same.\r\nGeumyoung says there is no problem because they test and go out. If the same symptoms appear with the new product, it may be a TV problem, so please contact the manufacturer.\r\nThe microphone standard is frequency response: 60hz to 15khz impedance: 600 omega+-3 at 1khz. I don't know if it's professional, but please let me know if the speed of outputting the microphone as sound after responding to the TV is slow or the microphone itself is a problem.\r\nAnswers\r\nIn the case of USB microphones, voice delay inevitably occurs in the process of converting digital signals into analog signals, and Geumyoung Mimi Noraebang uses AUX to enter the outside input of TV, so there is no symptom of delayed voice.\r\nPlease note that it is a characteristic part of the Geumyoung karaoke device.\r\nAmong the products of Geumyoung Noraebang, you need to use Geumyoung Mini Emp, an external device.\r\nIt's a pity that you're using a USB microphone, but it's hard to improve.\r\nPlease understand that it is a hardware SPEC."

Let's find out simply how to check if the cause is due to the product or the external environment caused by broadcasting signals and cables when the TV screen and screen are bad.\r\n2. While watching TV, the screen may appear intermittently or continuously like a mosaic or a specific part may be broken. It usually appears when watching a digital channel.\r\n3. Or there are lines on the screen or white dots that appear messy. In this case, it usually appears when watching an analog channel or a wired channel.\r\nThe cause of the screen\r\n1. If the above symptoms appear, it is a way to simply check whether the product is a TV problem or a broadcaster problem such as an external environment, that is, cable lines or cable wires.\r\n2. First, when connected to the antenna line or set-top box on the TV, please check if external input connection lines such as HDMI are connected normally.\r\n3. Select the Home or Menu button on the remote control.\r\n4. Move to the left and go to the \"Settings\" tab to select Settings.\r\n5. Please go down and select \"Customer Support\".\r\n6. Please choose self-diagnosis.\r\n7. Please select Start Screen Test.\r\n8. Please 'check' the image quality test notification message.\r\n9. Please check the video.\r\n10.

Select an example if it is similar to the image quality test screen. It shows two additional screens, and if this is also the same symptom, it is recommended to check the TV.\r\n12. When watching digital, you can check the broadcast signal with the antenna picture by pressing the home or menu button of the remote control to select \u201cCustomer Support\u201d, \u201cSelf Diagnosis\u201d, and \u201cSignal Information\u201d.\r\n13.

In addition, there are not many brokerage houses equipped with UHD transmission equipment at broadcasting stations, so the image quality is set low and transmitted to establish a stable reception environment.\r\nTo see UHD quality, please see content made exclusively for UHD. (There is a UHD-only channel on TV plus )\r\nQ2. Why should I use STB (or UHD KIT) to watch terrestrial UHD?\r\nA2.\r\nIn the case of products before 2016, it was possible to receive DVB-T2, a European method, and around June 2016, ATSC 3.0 UHD was adopted as a standard method in Korea and the main broadcast of terrestrial UHD began in May 2017. Please purchase STB (or UHD KIT) for products before 2016.\r\nQ3. When can I see the right UHD content?\r\nA3.\r\nIn consultation with each other, the government and broadcasting stations were scheduled to conduct 5% of all broadcasts as UHD content in 2017, and plan to gradually increase it to 25% in 2020 and 100% in 2028."

		"question": "It only works in front of the TV.",
		"answer": "Expected cause\r\nIt may occur due to insufficient battery capacity of the remote control or more than the remote control.\r\nMethod of action\r\nRemote control battery replacement description\r\nMost of the symptoms that the remote control does not work are caused by the lack of remaining battery capacity of the remote control.\r\nThe battery of the remote control provided at the time of purchase is naturally discharged in the distribution process, so it is difficult to use it as much as expected, and the remote control battery must be replaced with a new one.\r\nFor products sold as low-cost bundled products, the usage time is much shorter than that of genuine batteries, so it is recommended to use genuine batteries packaged in pairs.\r\nBattery polarity confirmation explanation\r\nWhen replacing the remote control battery, the battery polarity may be wrong and the remote control may not work.\r\nYou need to connect the battery - pole to an area that protrudes like a battery insertion spring.\r\nIf the battery + pole is connected to a spring-like protruding area, the remote control does not work.\r\n[Battery normal connection (+) polarity]\r\n[Battery normal connection (-) polarity]\r\nA new pair of battery replacement explanations\r\nWhen replacing the remote control battery, it may occur when using it by replacing the battery used by other products, not by replacing it in pairs.\r\nUnlike the old remote control in the past, the remote control of the recently sold model is equipped with smart functions and has high power consumption, so even batteries that operated normally in other products may not operate normally on TV.\r\nWhen replacing the remote control battery, you must replace the pair together.\r\n[Remocon battery-like pair]\r\n[Remocon battery different pair]\r\n[Note]\r\nThe remote control genuine battery is charged at 3.2 V and sold, and in the case of the TV remote control, if the battery voltage drops below 2 V, the remote control does not work.\r\nRemote controls for products other than TVs operate below 2 V, but in the case of Samsung remote controls, smart functions are applied and operate only under conditions above 2 V, so other products\r\nIf you replace the battery you used, the remote control will not work if it is less than 2 V, so you must replace the pair together when replacing the remote control battery.\r\nExplaining the Causes of Three-wavelength Fluorescent Lamps\r\nIf the fluorescent light in the home is turned off and the TV remote control is operated, the frequency of the three-wavelength fluorescent light may invade the TV remote control frequency area and cause frequency confusion.\r\nThe three-wavelength fluorescent lamp uses an electronic safety device exclusively instead of a coiled magnetic stabilizer, and electromagnetic waves generated from the stabilizer may cause frequency interference at the TV remote control receiver, causing symptoms of not receiving the remote control.\r\n[Method of Action]\r\nAs a temporary measure, there are ways to turn off and use fluorescent lights facing the TV, and to replace fluorescent lights with regular fluorescent lights rather than three-wavelength lights.\r\nPlease contact the nearest lighting company to replace the fluorescent light.\r\nIn 1997, the National Institute of Technology and Quality standardized the electronic stabilizer KS C8100 for fluorescent lamps, and the electronic stabilizer frequency for fluorescent lamps is stipulated to use bands other than 33 kHz to 40 kHz.\r\n\u203b It is caused by the frequency of the three-wavelength fluorescent lamp invading the frequency 38 kHz area of the TV remote control."

		"question": "It takes a long time to change the channel.",
		"answer": "Check synchronization time when channel is variable\r\nWhen changing the TV channel, a delay time occurs to synchronize the video and voice.\r\nIn the past, analog TVs did not require much time to process data by watching low-definition images, so they could be changed quickly when changing channels, but since broadcasting itself has a lot of data when watching high-definition digital broadcasting, synchronization time of about 1 to 2 seconds is required when changing channels, resulting in symptoms that take a long time to change channels.\r\nPlease note that this is caused by an increase in data throughput while watching high-definition digital broadcasting, not product failure, and is used as a common symptom of all digital TVs around the world.\r\nIt may take a long time to change the channel even when using STB (set-top box).\r\nIf the sudden channel change is delayed, you need to check if the set-top is being updated regardless of the TV.\r\nInquiries need to be made to each set-top carrier."

		"question": "The sound of all the channels suddenly went down.",
		"answer": "Reason for revision of volume standard\r\nRevision of the volume standards for broadcasting programs following the revision of the Broadcasting Act;\r\nAs of May 2, 2016, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning has established standard volume standards for digital broadcasting programs and advertisements to ease viewer inconvenience caused by rapid changes in volume between and within channels.\r\n(Compliance with Article 70-2 (1) of the Broadcasting Act)\r\nQ &amp; A\r\nQ1. Did the sound suddenly turn down?\r\nA1. As the standard law for digital television broadcast volume is applied from May 2, it is normal that the sound becomes smaller than before.\r\nQ2. Is there any reason to set the volume standard lower than before?\r\nA2. Due to inequality caused by competition for sound levels between broadcasting channel users (home shopping, sports, dramas, etc.), there was a difference in volume between channels and programs in the channel, and the inconvenience was up to consumers.\r\nIn order to solve this inconvenience, genre-specific characteristic channels such as music, movies, and sports are cases where the law has been revised, recognizing that volume management at the production stage is necessary.\r\n(\u203b If professional music programs such as classical music and Korean traditional music are provided live, volume standards are not applied)\r\nQ3. Is there a standard value for volume level?\r\nA3. It is difficult to guide the standard value of the volume level. The standard volume prescribed by the relevant law is -24LKFS, and the tolerance is \u00b12 dB.\r\n.(\u203b LKFS is a standard unit of volume value calculated in consideration of human auditory cognitive characteristics)\r\nQ4. But I'd like to check the TV problem.\r\nA4. You can check it through the function of self-diagnosis.\r\nMenu \u2192 Customer Support \u2192 Self Diagnosis \u2192\r\nSound quality test\r\nUsing\r\nConstant volume\r\nPlease check if this comes out.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it can be seen that the volume size that was different for each channel and within the channel is now a uniform volume size.\r\n(There are menu differences depending on TV model. Please refer to the user manual )\r\nTesting the sound quality of TV self-diagnosis\r\n1. Remote control\r\nHome button\r\nClick\r\n2. In the lower left-hand corner,\r\nSet\r\nPlease choose.\r\n3.

How can I know that the law has been revised even though consumers have not been notified?\r\nA5. It was announced through the following broadcast by broadcasting company.\r\n[Publicity text for viewers (TV subtitles)]\r\nWith the implementation of related laws (Article 70-2 (1) of the Broadcasting Act) to resolve the volume imbalance between broadcasting channels and programs, digital TV broadcasting programs of all broadcasting media (terrestrial waves, cables, satellites, etc.) will be broadcast in compliance with the standard volume from 4 a.m. on May 2, 2016.

If you switch to another channel during recording (or reservation recording), \"Would you like to end recording and switch channels? [Yes] [No].\"\r\nSince it is not a 2TUNER method, it is impossible to watch other channels during recording.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nCan I record even if I turn off the TV during recording (or reservation recording)?\r\n\u2192 It is possible. Even if the TV is turned off, recording is stopped, or if the recording completion time is not over, recording continues.\r\nHowever, recording is stopped if the power is cut off, not power OFF (power waiting).\r\n\r\n5.\r\nDoesn't the phrase \"recording\" disappear in the upper left corner during recording?\r\n\u2192 Yes, the phrase keeps popping up to let you know that it is recording. It also moves little by little to protect the screen.\r\nIn addition, recording for less than 10 seconds is not carried out during general recording, so \"records for less than 10 seconds are not stored.

		"question": "Do you use RGB color filter for Samsung TV?",
		"answer": "Function guide\r\nRGB color filter\r\n- Color filter is a thin layer that represents various colors in LCD.\r\n- When the light from the LCD backlight passes through the color filter through the liquid crystal, it passes through the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) parts of the color filter, and the color of the light changes.\r\n- It is the same principle that when the flashlight light is shined on the cellophane, the light changes to various colors depending on the color of the cellophane.\r\nIf there is no color filter, LCD will be expressed only bright and dark like black and white TV.\r\n- Most displays use a combination of red (R), green (G), and blue (B), which are the three primary colors of light, for each pixel to express various colors.\r\n- In the color filter layer, sub-pixels of R, G, and B are generally placed for each pixel, and these three colors represent more than millions of colors.\r\n- Samsung TV products use all model RGB color filters based on LCD and LED products.\r\n- RGBW is a specification with more white (W) filters, and among the products released by Samsung, RGBW type color filters were applied only to KN55S9CAF products in the past."

		"question": "Your voice speed isn't right.",
		"answer": "Explanation of the cause of the broadcast signal\r\nIf symptoms that do not match the screen and voice speed occur, it may occur in some or all broadcast programs due to broadcast signals transmitted by broadcasting stations.\r\nBecause the processing speed of the video signal and the voice signal is different, there is a slight difference in the speed of the video/voice, and although it is not usually felt, the speed difference may feel sensory depending on some broadcasting programs.\r\nIt is not a symptom caused by a product abnormality, so please feel free to use it.\r\nSpeaker delay time setting method\r\nWhen listening to TV voice through the home theater, the video is displayed directly on the TV screen, but since the voice signal is output from the TV through the home theater, some delay time occurs in the process of transmitting the voice from the TV to the home theater.\r\nSome of the functions of the TV can be set up by applying a function that can minimize the delay time.\r\n[Menu \u2192 Sound \u2192 SPDIF Settings \u2192 Delay Time Adjustment]\r\nIf the voice is faster than the screen: Please set the delay time adjustment higher.

[-]\r\nEven if the delay time is adjusted, there is a time when voice is transmitted from the TV to the home theater, so symptoms that the screen / voice speed is not correct may occur.\r\nThis is not a product problem, but a problem caused by the time the voice is transmitted from the TV to the home theater, so please refer to it when using it.\r\nMenu - Sound\r\nSPDIF Configuration\r\nIf the voice is faster than the screen, the delay time\r\nPlease set it high\r\nIf the voice is slower than the screen, the delay time\r\nPlease set it low.\r\nExplain the cause of set-top box\r\nWhen watching a broadcast through a set-top box, the speed of video/voice may vary slightly depending on the speed of video/voice signal transmission from the set-top box to the TV.
